# elucidate.sh

Bash script to build and install Enlightenment 23 on **Ubuntu Focal Fossa**. :bicyclist:

Intended audience: ~~beginner~~ - ~~intermediate~~ - advanced

## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/elucidate.git .elucidate
```
That creates a new hidden folder named ".elucidate" in your home directory.

Copy the file "elucidate.sh" from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable.

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./elucidate.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open Terminal and simply type:

```bash
elucidate.sh
```
That's it.

Mind the cows! :cow2: :cow2: :cow2:

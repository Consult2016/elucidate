# elucidate.sh

Make sure that the `git` and `build-install` packages are installed then clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/elucidate.git .elucidate
```
That creates a new hidden folder named _".epanema"_ in your home directory.

Please copy the file _"epanema.sh"_ from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable**

```bash
chmod +x epanema.sh
```

Then issue the following command

```bash
./epanema.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open Terminal and simply type

```bash
epanema.sh
```
That's it.

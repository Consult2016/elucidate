# elucidate.sh

Bash script to build and install Enlightenment 23 on **Ubuntu Focal Fossa**.

Intended audience: ~~beginner~~ - ~~intermediate~~ - advanced

## Get started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/elucidate.git .elucidate
```
That creates a new hidden folder named _".elucidate"_ in your home directory.

Next, copy the file _"elucidate.sh"_ from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x elucidate.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./elucidate.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open Terminal and simply type:

```bash
elucidate.sh
```
That's it.
